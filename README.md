# MLP-and-GMM---EECE5644
Multilayer perceptron(MLP) were used to approximate or estimate the class posteriors.
Minimum average cross-entropy was used to train the MLP, and the trained models were then used to approximate a MAP(Maximum-a-posteriori) classification to achieve the minimum probability of error(Pe) on the validation dataset.
We make use of the Gaussian Mixture model(GMM) as the true probability density function for 2 â€“ dimensional real valued data synthesis.
This GMM given below has 4 different components with different mean vectors , different covariance matrices, and different probability for each Gaussian to be selected for that sample.
